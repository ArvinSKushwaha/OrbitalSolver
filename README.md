# Orbital Solver

The goal is this project is as straightforward as it sounds: to numerically approximate solutions to the Time-Independent Schrodinger Equations for atomic orbitals.

The derivations and calculations used to perform this project will be thoroughly documented in the `.tex` and `.pdf` file in this repo. The code is also fully commented for readability.

If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to raise an issue or write an email to me at [arvin.singh.kushwaha@gmail.com](mailto:arvin.singh.kushwaha@gmail.com).
